# LawGPT – Chatbot for Legal Support of Marginalized Communities  

A conversational AI system that democratizes access to **legal information** for underserved communities.  
LawGPT leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, semantic search, and multilingual support to provide simplified legal explanations in real time.  

---

## Features
-  **LLM-Powered** – Uses **Mistral-7B** fine-tuned with Hugging Face embeddings for contextual responses.  
-  **Semantic Search** – Employs **FAISS vector DB** for similarity-based retrieval of legal documents.  
-  **Multilingual Support** – Answers queries in multiple languages, breaking down legal barriers.  
-  **Focused Knowledge Base** – Covers women & child protection laws, disability rights, caste-based protections, and more.  
-  **Interactive UI** – Built with **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use web interface.  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, FAISS, Streamlit  
- **Model:** Mistral-7B (Instruction fine-tuned)  
- **Embeddings:** HuggingFace `nomic-embed-text-v1`  
- **Database:** FAISS Vector DB

##  How It Works
1. **Document Processing**  
   - Legal docs → chunked (1024 chars with overlap) → embeddings created.  
   - Stored in FAISS vector DB for fast similarity search.  

2. **User Query**  
   - User enters legal query in chat window.  
   - Query embedding created with Hugging Face.  

3. **Semantic Retrieval**  
   - Top-k similar chunks retrieved from FAISS DB.  

4. **LLM Response**  
   - Mistral-7B generates context-aware, multilingual answer.  

---

##  Results
- **Average Coherence Score:** 0.91  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 0.80  
- Demonstrated ability to provide reliable, contextually relevant answers in **Tamil, English, Hindi, and other languages**.  
- Reduced language barrier and improved legal literacy for marginalized users.
